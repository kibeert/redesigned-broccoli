# redesigned-broccoli
contains the use of non access modifiers such as final and absract ,  inheritance and polymorphism

# final
this is a non-access modifiers describing that the class cannot be inherited by other classes rather than the one on which was created

# Abstract
the class cannot be used to create objects in that to access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class

# Inheritance 
is a mechanism that allows the child class to inherit properties and atttributes of the parent class.\
provides a way in which the child class can reuse the code without having to rewrite it.\
Also alows for creating specialized versions of a class, by adding or modifying the behavior of the superclass.

# Polymorphism
is a concept that allows object of differnt classes to be treated differently depending on their conditions.\
There are two types of polymorphism:\

1. compile-time / method overloading.\
occurs when there are multiple methods  with the same name but different parameters in a class
the compiler determines the method to be called based on the number and types of arguments passed to it at compile time

2. Runtime \ method overriding.\
occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\
the runtime system determines which method to call baseed on the type of object at runtime
